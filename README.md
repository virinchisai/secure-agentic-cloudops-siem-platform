# 🔐 Secure Agentic CloudOps SIEM Platform

![Python CI](https://github.com/virinchisai/secure-agentic-cloudops-siem-platform/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)

A cloud-native, event-driven **SIEM-style security and CloudOps platform** that demonstrates **log ingestion, streaming pipelines, detection engineering, and scalable backend system design**.

This project simulates how modern security platforms ingest logs, process them in real time, detect suspicious activity, and persist alerts for investigation — while also outlining a clear roadmap toward **agentic, LLM-powered security automation**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Ingest logs:** Accept raw security logs through a REST API.
- **Stream events:** Stream logs using Kafka-compatible infrastructure (Redpanda).
- **Detect in real time:** Apply detection logic and scoring as events flow through the system.
- **Persist signals:** Store normalized events and alerts in PostgreSQL for investigation.
- **Support investigation:** Enable query-driven validation and basic investigation workflows.
- **Show system design:** Demonstrate production-grade, decoupled microservice architecture.
- **Enable a roadmap:** Provide a clear path to agentic security automation.

## 🚧 Implementation Status

This repository intentionally includes **both implemented components and a forward-looking architecture**.

### ✅ Implemented (fully working)

- Ingest service (FastAPI)
- Kafka-compatible streaming (Redpanda)
- Detection service consuming Kafka events
- PostgreSQL persistence for events and alerts
- End-to-end data flow validation
- One-command local execution (`scripts/run_all.sh`)
- Dockerized infrastructure

### 🧭 Planned / roadmap

- Agentic LLM reasoning engine
- Vector knowledge base for contextual retrieval
- Automated remediation workflows
- API gateway with authentication (JWT / OAuth / RBAC)
- SIEM dashboards and visualizations
- Cloud deployment (AWS / GCP)
- CI/CD pipelines (tests, SAST, secrets scanning)

> ⚠️ **Scope note**  
> Advanced components described later in this README represent **architectural intent and future roadmap**.  
> The current implementation focuses on a production-grade ingestion, streaming, detection, and persistence pipeline.

## 🧠 Architecture explanation (step-by-step)

### 1️⃣ Client
- Represents VPN gateways, authentication servers, firewalls, cloud services, applications
- Sends logs as JSON payloads over HTTP

### 2️⃣ Ingest service (FastAPI)
- Validates incoming payloads
- Normalizes logs into a consistent event model
- Assigns a unique `event_id`
- Publishes events to Kafka topic `logs.raw`

**Why it matters**
- Decouples producers from consumers
- Enables independent scaling
- Kafka buffers spikes and protects downstream services

### 3️⃣ Kafka / Redpanda
- Event streaming backbone
- Reliable buffering and replay
- Fan-out to one or more consumers

### 4️⃣ Detection service
- Consumes from `logs.raw`
- Applies detection rules and scoring
- Writes alerts to PostgreSQL
- Optionally emits derived topics (`alerts.scored`)

### 5️⃣ PostgreSQL
- Stores normalized events and derived alerts
- Enables investigation and historical analysis
